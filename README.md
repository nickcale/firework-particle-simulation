## Firework Particle Simulation

A colorful, private firework show hosted in your browser. A sample of what it looks like is hosted [here]: https://nickcale.github.io/firework-particle-simulation/ .

This code was built on top of the code written by Daniel Shiffman from [thecodingtrain.com]: https://thecodingtrain.com/ . The original challenge can be found [here]: https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/27-fireworks . In this update, I sought to make the code more object oriented and readable.
